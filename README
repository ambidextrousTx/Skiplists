Skip lists are a simple randomized structure, which facilitate
the operations search, insert and delete. Skip lists are implemented
as a hierarchy of linked lists, kind of like a subway system with
express stops [top level] as well as normal stops [bottom level]. The 
bottom level has all the stops, while the express level has a 
few stops. The search is done by navigating through the express level
first, then descending to the bottom level and making the required 
moves. For a log_2(n) level skip list structure, the search time
is O(log_2 n). In fact, a skip list looks like a level-linked B+ tree.
